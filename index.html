  <div class="Together">
    <h3>A history lesson</h3>
    <p>Morgan and Alex met when they signed a lease for an apartment together.
    <br>Yes, you read that right.
    <br>Both Alex and Morgan went to Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.
    <br>They signed a lease with a mutual friend (Leslie) on a cold day in late January and the move-in date was set for August to correspond with the new school year.
    <br>Once the lease was signed, the started to hang out together to get to know eachother better.
    <br>It took about a month and a half before Morgan made the first move (while watching the Oscars together, something Alex probably wouldn't willingly do on his own).
    <br>It's been many years since that winter of 2011, but they're finally gettin' hitched!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="Proposal">
    <h3>Poppin' that question</h3>
    <p>Alex asked Morgan to marry him in Kew Gardens, London, UK on June 25, 2016.
    <br>It was pouring rain and they were on a bridge in the middle of lake on their first day in Europe.
    <br>Two minutes earlier, he joked that it was the perfect time to "tie his shoe". A joke he had been playing on her, pretending to get down one knee, for a while.
    <br>When he actually did get down on one knee (completely soaked his khaki pants), she asked "are you serious?"
    <br>He then said,"Well I'm not down here for no reason!"
    <br>Once Morgan pulled her head out of her butt and realized this was the real deal, she said YES!
    <br>And they promptly made a few international phone calls totaling $25.
    <br>Totally worth it!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="Wedding">
    <h3>Gettin' hitched</h3>
    <p>You probably are ready for those deets.
    <br>Alex and Morgan are getting married at the Emel House in Scenic Beach State Park, Washington.
    <br>Yes, Washington.
    <br>A place that neither of them have lived. (But Alex really wants to move there.)
    <br>Be prepared for breathtaking scenery everywhere you look, temperate climates, and lots of coffee, beer, and liberals!
    <br>We are asking that everyone wear one some of the wedding colors on the day of.
    <br>Since we are not having a bridal party, we would like everyone to be our 'bridal party!'
    </p>
